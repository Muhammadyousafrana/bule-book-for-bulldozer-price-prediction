# Bule Book for Bulldozer Price Prediction

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the sale prices of bulldozers using historical auction data. It is inspired by the "Blue Book for Bulldozers" Kaggle competition and is implemented primarily in Jupyter Notebooks for easy exploration and reproducibility.

## Project Overview

Predicting equipment prices accurately is crucial for buyers and sellers in the used heavy equipment market. This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to predict bulldozer prices based on various machine attributes and auction data.

## Dataset

The dataset is based on publicly available auction data for bulldozers and includes features such as:
- Equipment type and model
- Year of manufacture
- Usage statistics (hours, condition)
- Auction details (date, location, sale price)
- Additional categorical and numerical attributes

> **Note:** Due to licensing, the full dataset may not be included in this repository. Please refer to the [Kaggle competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data) for access.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Multiple regression models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Visualization of results

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and set up your Python environment. All analysis is performed in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Muhammadyousafrana/bule-book-for-bulldozer-price-prediction.git
   cd bule-book-for-bulldozer-price-prediction
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

- Open the relevant notebook (e.g., `notebooks/main.ipynb`)
- Follow the notebook cells for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

> **Tip:** Update the dataset path in the notebook if necessary.

## Results

- The best-performing model and evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, R²) are discussed in the final notebook.
- Visualizations compare predicted prices to actual auction outcomes.
